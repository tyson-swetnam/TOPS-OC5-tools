# TOPS Core Curriculum Module 5: Open Science Tools and Resources

Welcome! This last Module provides a collection of tools that are available to increase the visibility and discoverability of your project. It complements the previous OpenCore Modules (Ethos of Open Science, Open Data, Open Software, and Open Results) by enhancing the practical implementation of the Open Science concepts explained previously. While earlier modules focused on the concepts, advantages, and disadvantages of Open Science practices, this module will focus more on the practical applications of Open Science practices. We focus on a few key tools, and highlight how they fit across the research lifecycle. 

There are four lessons in this chapter. Lesson 1 provides an introduction to Open Science tools, with a focus on the advantages of open tools and how they fit into the research lifecycle. Lesson 2 highlights a few key tools across the research lifecycle, including open science tools for protocols, data, code, results, and authoring. Lesson 3 focuses on open science tools for reproducibility, including computational notebooks such as R Markdown and Quarto. Lesson 4 is fully dedicated to open science communities, focusing on why and how you can engage with, build, or lead a community.
